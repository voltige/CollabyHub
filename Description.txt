Pitch

I would like to create an application that allows any company, association or self-employed business to receive reservations for their services. A directory is created for all companies by type. An administrator section allows you to manage the website.

It also allows anyone who does not have a company or association to create an account and collaborate or exchange as on a social network.

A collaboration section allows anyone to make participatory payment on projects.

A tools section brings together for free the most requested tools online by users(like a calendar, a note-taking application, an application for reading, managing, modifying PDFs.).


Target Audience

business professionals & collaborators, self-employed, association and individuals.

Design
Implement a sophisticated primary palette that conveys trust and professionalism, accented with vibrant secondary colors to highlight social and collaborative features, ensuring clear visual hierarchy and section differentiation.

The dominant color are Blue, white and black.
